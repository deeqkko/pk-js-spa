    <!--Assignment 1:

    Make a web page which has a number input field, which asks the age of the user
    in years. Age must be a valid positive integer. Then you calculate the
    approximate birth year of the user.

    birth year = current year - age

    Make user interface so that it will work on all popular devices and browsers,
    including mobile. And so that it will behave nicely e.g. output an error
    message, in case user gives no input or erroneous input
